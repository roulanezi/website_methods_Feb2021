library(ggplot2)

Democracy <- read_stata("Democracy.dta")

GDP_Dem<- subset(Democracy, select = c("Dem_Gov1984", "GDPPC1984")) # we subset the dataset called "Democracy"

R can make complicated things easy and the package below will save you a lot of time. In your assignments you should have tables similar to the ones you see in official reports and journal publications. The `stargazer` package will allow to do this without having to update your table multiple times.


```{r stargazer, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(model.1,
          type="html",
          out="model_one.doc")
```
**Note**: If you are using LATEX instead of Word you don't have to specify the type and the output (out).
