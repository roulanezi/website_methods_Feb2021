      <description>When we are starting a new research project, quite often we assume that we need to collect data. However, this is not always required as there are many good quality datasets that are readily available for use. Most surveys are designed by very experienced researchers and cover a wide range of topics.
For example, GESIS-Leibniz Institute of the Social Sciences,houses almost all comparative and German social surveys in Europe. Almost all European countries have a data archive.</description>

      <description>Start by creating a folder dedicated to our module. On your computer go to My Documents and create a new folder entitled POLXXXX (XXXX indicates the code of our module). Go back to SurreyLearn and download the dataset in the folder. Go back to RStudio, create a new script file, name it Lab1.R.
The first two lines of your script file should include the following three lines.
rm(list = ls()) # This command will clean your workspace setwd(&amp;quot;~/POLXXXX&amp;quot;) # This command will tell RStudio to read and save files at the folder POLXXXX load(&amp;quot;EVS_UK.</description>

      <title>The mean and the median</title>

      <description>The arithmetic mean, in other words the average, is the most commonly used measure of central tendency. Even without realising it we often calculate the mean, for example we use the mean to calculate how much energy we are using per month.
We all know how to calculate the mean, by diving the sum of all observations by the total number of observations. Let’s try to do that in R.</description>

      <title>The mode</title>

      <description>In contrast to the other two measures of central tendency we don’t need a build-in function to calculate the mode. Simply because it is very easy to do it on our own. Think what the mode is…
To find the value that appears most often, all we have to do is to tabulate the variable we are interested in. This is easily done with the table() function.
dem_mode&amp;lt;-table(EVS_UK$v142) dem_mode ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## 24 8 11 15 90 66 84 212 223 1031 In simple words the table() function creates a table that tell us the number of people (cases) that fall into each category.</description>

      <title>Measures of dispersion</title>

      <description>The range of a variable is the simplest and easiest measure of dispersion we can calculate, but at the same time is the less reliable one, this is because it depends only upon two values- the two extremes- that quite often are also outliers and are far away from the centre of the distribution.
The variance is a measure that takes into consideration how far is each value from the mean.</description>

      <title>Categorical variables</title>

      <description>Some variables, consist of named categories, e.g. the name of your favourite brand. A category-variable, or a categorical variable refers to any variable that puts individuals into categories. These variables are also called nominal variables. The word nominal comes from Latin (nominalis=of a name), because we are giving names to the values of our variable.
With categorical variables we want to understand the frequency with which each value appears in our dataset.</description>
