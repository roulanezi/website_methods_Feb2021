```{r, include=FALSE}
load("bes.RData")
library(dplyr)
eco_voting<-bes %>%select(b02,Age,edlevel,e01,l01,l02,l03,l04,p01)
View(eco_voting)
eco_voting[eco_voting <=-1] <- NA
eco_voting[eco_voting <=-2] <- NA
```


## Create the dependent variable

Our dependent variable is a dichotomous, dummy variable where $1$ means that the respondent voted for the party in government - this is what we are trying to explain- and $0$ means that they voted for another party. 

```{r dependent}
eco_voting<-eco_voting %>% mutate(incumbent=case_when(b02==2~1, b02==1~0, b02>=3~0)) 
```

You may use the `table()` function to double check the new variable entitled `incumbent':

```{r check}
table(eco_voting$b02)
table(eco_voting$incumbent)
```
