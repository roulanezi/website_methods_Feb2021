<p>In this section we will learn how to run a regression analysis with more than one independent variables.</p>
<p>Almost all social phenomena have more than one cause. To control, statistically, for all possible causes social scientists employ multinomial regression analysis.</p>
<p>The multivariate regression model is the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y_{i}=\alpha+\beta_{1}X_{i}+ \beta_{2}Z_{i}+ u_{i}\]</span></p>
<p>The interpretation of the slope coefficients for the multivariate- in this case three variable model- is similar to the bivariate model but with one major difference. The coefficient <span class="math display">\[\beta_{1}\]</span> represents the effect of X on Y while keeping Z (the third variable) constant. The same will hold if we had a model with four variables.</p>
