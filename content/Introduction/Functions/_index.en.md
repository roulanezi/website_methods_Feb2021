What is a function? In simple words, a function is a set of instructions that you want to use. A function is a code written to carry out a specific task. For example, you want to know the sum of 1+2+3, instead of  using the + sign we can use the sum function to add numbers. For example:

```{r addition2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
1+2+3
```

or

```{r sum, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
sum(1,2,3)
```

or

```{r sum3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
sum(1:3)
```
