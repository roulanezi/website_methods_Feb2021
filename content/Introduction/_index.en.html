<p>Install R and RStudio on your computer by visiting the <a href="https://appstore.surrey.ac.uk/login">Surrey App Store</a> and logging in using your university account details. You may find additional information on how to install R and RStudio on your personal computer on SurreyLearn.</p>

<p>Now let’s see what each one these windows is doing. You can type some code in the Console window and when you press <strong>ENTER</strong> the software will run (execute) that code. Typically, you will see some output in the Console, as the results from your analysis, but sometimes you might also get a warning message or an error message. Don’t worry if you get an error message <span style="color:red"> <strong>(typically they appear in red colour)</strong> </span>, nothing will happen!</p>
