## Basic mathematical operations

Let's get familiar with the Console by calculating some simple in RStudio. In it's simplest form R can be used as very powerful calculator.

```{r addition, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
5+5
```

Now let's try to do the same by using some mathematical operations such as subtraction ( - ), division ( / ), and multiplication ( * ).


**Subtraction**
```{r subtraction, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
5-3
```

**Division**
```{r Division, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
10/6
```

**Multiplication**
```{r Multiplication, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
7*5
```

You can edit your code in the console by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The **UP** and **DOWN** keys will re-run your code without typing it again. You may edit your code by using the **LEFT** and/or the **RIGHT** keys
