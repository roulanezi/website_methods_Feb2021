<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
<p>By the end of this section you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how to plot continuous variables</li>
<li>Use boxplots, line plots , violin plots and 3D plots for continuous variables</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="one-continuous-variable" class="section level3">
<h3>One continuous variable</h3>
<p>For the following example we will use a variable describing citizens’ satisfaction with the political system, the name of the variable is <code>v144</code>. We will use the <code>names()</code> function to give a meaningful name to the variable.</p>
<p>The general formula is:
names(my_data)[names(my_data) == “old.variable.name”] &lt;- “new_variable_name”</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(EVS_UK)[names(EVS_UK)==&quot;v144&quot;]&lt;- &quot;pol_sat&quot;
